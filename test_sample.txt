
Machine Learning Overview
========================

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on 
developing systems that can learn from data. It has three main types:

1. Supervised Learning: Learning from labeled data
2. Unsupervised Learning: Finding patterns in unlabeled data  
3. Reinforcement Learning: Learning through trial and error

Applications include image recognition, natural language processing, 
recommendation systems, and autonomous vehicles.
